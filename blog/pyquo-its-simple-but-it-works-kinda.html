        <h2>PyQuo: It's simple, but it works... kinda.</h2>
<p>Well, <a href="http://autonomouse.com/blog/strapdown-its-simple-but-it-works-kinda.html">as predicted</a>, that didn't last long.</p>
<p>I ditched Strapdown.js and reverted to my usual trick of making an elaborate, one-man, self-hosted thing called <a href="https://github.com/autonomouse/PyQuo">PyQuo</a> - it's an GNU Affero GPLv3 licenced static site generator, based on Python3 that used Markdown syntax. Needs a lot of work, but it'll do for now :-)</p>
