        <h2>Strapdown: It's simple, but it works... kinda.</h2>
<p>I've decided to start keeping a blog again, and the very first decision is what to use to host it.</p>
<p>Somehow, it doesn't feel right using blogger or medium or one of those, and I like the flexibility of markdown and keeping stuff in a git repository. Life's too short for elaborate, one-man, self-hosted computer wizardry which I'll forget how I implemented in T minus 3 seconds, so I have opted for the eyebrow-rasingly-named <a href="https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown">Strapdown</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Simple.</p>
<p>Simple is good. Especially when I have very little doubt that I'll end up changing my mind by next week.</p>
