So I guess the idea of these bloggy things is to keep up to date and relevant, and give an up to the minute account of what's going on in the world. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a back-log to write about, so expect delays for a while. That's kinda why I set up this blog (amongst [other reasons](autonomouse-is-dead-long-live-autonomouse.html/)), because I had a fair bit on my mind, and I wanted to write it all down to organise my thoughts. Also having some record of events that won't become yet another victim to my thimble-sized memory would be nice.

But I guess that that's the way it goes - when there's lots of interesting stuff going on, one* tends to be too busy experiencing it to write about it!

So this is why I'm going to go on about Glastonbury (which I got back from last week) rather than gibber on about something more contemporary, like why <a href="http://www2.b3ta.com/host/creative/19645/1183295825/72virgins.JPG">some dosey islamic terrorist gave himself third degree burns in Glasgow</a> instead of killing himself and everyone else like he wanted to. I guess I'll just wait until the next pointless attack happens ('cos it will) to go on about why I hate religion for this and many other reasons.

SOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo, this leads us seamlessly onto the subject of the Glastonbury Festival 2007:

I'm still having flashbacks about the mud, but no-one in Sheffield seems to care seeing as though it kinda... er... <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/6755459.stm"> sunk</a>.

The Kooks
The Killers
The Manic Street Preachers
Kaiser Chiefs
