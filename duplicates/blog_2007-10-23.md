There comes a time in every man's life when he needs to grow a beard.

There also comes a time, about 4 weeks later, when his girlfriend tells him to shave that stupid bloody face-rug off else she's leaving him. And so, alas, the beard had to go.
Just remember the good times, beardy. Sniff... I'm sorry, I was very attached to it... (rubbish, Darren).

However, no facial hair removal would be complete without the age-old "shaving of the beard ceremony". Here are the highlights:

<strong>Number 1 - "The Will Riker"</strong>
This is our starting point - a full beard. Distinguished. Dashing. Charming. This is the beard of kings, not to mention various goodies from Lord of the Rings. Very nice.

<strong>Number 2 - "The Bouncer"</strong>
Oh dear. Like this shot wasn't potentially bad enough without me looking like I badly need the toilet.

The goatee is the face-fluff of choice for bouncers and P.E teachers alike. It couldn't stay.

<strong>Number 3 - "The Metallica"</strong>

Now this is more like it:

<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20965.JPG" title="TheMetallica_Front"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20965.JPG" alt="TheMetallica_Front" height="30%" width="30%" /></a><a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20966.JPG" title="TheMetallica_Side"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20966.JPG" alt="TheMetallica_Side" height="30%" width="30%" /></a>

But why stop there?

Snarl: <a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20967.JPG" title="Metallica_Snarl"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20967.JPG" alt="Metallica_Snarl" height="50%" width="50%" /></a>

Grrrr: <a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/themetallica.JPG" title="Metallica_Grrrrr"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/themetallica.JPG" alt="Metallica_Grrrrr" height="50%" width="50%" /></a>

Hang on, in a certain light, it almost looks... oh no - it's the biker from the village people:

<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20971.JPG" title="YMCY"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20971.JPG" alt="YMCY" height="65%" width="65%" /></a>

(Yes, that's right, "It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.Y." - I think my mum was meant to be doing an "A" there...)

<strong>Number 3 - "The Village Person"</strong>

All that's missing for the true village person wannabe is to get rid of the chin-fur, so off it goes:
<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20972.JPG" title="TheBiker_Front"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20972.JPG" alt="TheBiker_Front" height="30%" width="30%" /></a><a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20974.JPG" title="TheBiker_Side"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20974.JPG" alt="TheBiker_Side" height="30%" width="30%" /></a>

I think Marj was beginning to get a little bored by this point, but the ceremony cannot be interrupted for it is sacred.

<strong>Number 3 - "The Leslie Phillips"</strong>
Ding-dong...? Not very convincing. I just look like a twat:

<strong>Number 4 - "The Adolf"</strong>
We've had the Will Riker, the biker, so the obvious next step had to be the third reich-er.

<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20982.JPG" title="The3rdReicher_Front"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20982.JPG" alt="The3rdReicher_Front" height="30%" width="30%" /></a>

It had to be done. I toyed with the idea of keeping this one, but the dubious manner in which my arm was raised due to the holding of the camera was enough to convince me that I should probably finish the job.... and quickly!

<strong>Number 4 - "The Itchy Face"</strong>

Back to "normal":

<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20985.JPG" title="Back to “normal”"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ssl20985.JPG" alt="Back to “normal”" height="30%" width="30%" /></a>

All done, with nothing left of my beard but sweet, sweet memories...
