This is one of the postings I'd started to think about and write down a few notes for, but didn't get around to posting it. So it's not really in chronological order. Soz. So, the last time anyone heard from me was when I was mid-IBAGS*. I managed to type that one briefly before leaving to go souvenir shopping for the missus. Its weird; I thought that I would have loads of spare time and be generally bored whilst out there, so I took my laptop along and had grand plans that I was going to update this blog while out there, but as it turned out I spent most of the conference in the pub.

The ABRG** is somewhat renowned for enjoying a drink or two and this had always previously been a good thing: it was nice to be part of such a friendly, social research group (especially compared to some of the other groups in the psychology department), however, events at this conference have started to make me slightly paranoid.

One of the first nights we were there, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that the first drink was free with the complementary barbecue. Once that drink was done with, one of us went to the bar to buy the first round, and found out that this, too, was free. This was an international conference and so there were a lot of folks there, so we assumed that they'd lost track of how many drinks they'd distributed already.

At this point, a kind of mania took us over - you know, the sort that you only get when you realise that you've managed to get something for nothing. The decision was made, we'd go through every type of beer available until the free beer stopped flowing. But of course, it didn't stop flowing; what actually happened was that it was a free bar all night and the Europeans took it steady and enjoyed their drink, while we went nuts and enjoyed our drink a little too much. That this stuff was like drinking rocket fuel seemed to be offset by the fact that it came in mere half pint receptacles, which had the unfortunate side effect of making us think we'd had much less that we actually did.

After trying each of the beers on tap, of which there were four, we tried them again. And again.

There tends to be a few moments in your life when you take a look around and a grim realisation takes you over. One of them happened here. Obviously woefully unprepared for the English, the bar that we were in did not have adequate glass collective facilities and I noted that our table was filled with approximately 47,412 empty glasses (give or take). I took the momentary lapse in conversation as an opportunity to have a nose around to see what everyone else was up to, as you do, and to my horror noticed that everybody else's table seemed to only have one or two glasses on it. And everyone was giving us that cold piercing stare that can only be used to full effect by the sober. We were no longer a table of notable Professors, Doctors and PhD students, we had turned into a mob of English drunks. I could tell that they expected us to burst into football hooliganism at any point. So I did what any slightly self-conscious Englishman would do at a moment like this. I got the next round in and drank them all away.....

The previous night when we arrived at the hotel, I had a headache due to a lack of sleep and an excess of panic that came with the last-minute poster  preparation, and so only had the one at the bar and decided to hit the sack early. My colleagues however, being more organised (or in Jon's case, simply more used to it) stayed out for a few pints in the hotel bar and made friends with Geoff the Dutch barman (that was his name!). They had warmed to him with his tales of Kazakhstanis asking him, Borat-style, where they could get 'sexy time' and other, less funny stories which I didn't bother remembering. I'd met him briefly that night, but I really don't remember him scowling so much. In fact, I'd say that he scowled from the point that we re-entered the hotel bar on the night of the barbecue, pissed as a newt, until the day we left the hotel. On reflection, this probably wasn't then the best opportunity to try my hand at [networking](darren-returns.html) (I spent the rest of the conference feeling slightly sheepish). Jon spoke with him the next day and he said that we were being generally obnoxious. This was probably to be expected, but it still comes as a bit of a shock. You get so used to drinking that you go around trying to be sociable and inclusive and whatnot, and you never consider that you're actually being an arsehole*** - you forget that its a very potent drug.

I'm only concerned because of the stuff I've been thinking about recently. Everything we English do has revolve around drinking somehow. It really shouldn't be like this and I'm getting tired of it. Every time I want to go out and be friendly and try to meet new people, I've not only got to keep fucking up my body with this shit, but I've now gotta pay Â£3 a pint for the privilege (which might be why we go so mad for a free bar?). There's an Oliver Reed quote that says "I drink to make other people interesting", but if we all honestly tried a bit more to reach out to random strangers, we wouldn't feel so inhibited and so we wouldn't need to drink so much to remove those inhibitions when we do go out! I now see what they mean when the government says we need to be more European in our approach to drinking.

The most memorable event in the whole Holland experience was the formal meal on the last night. After the meal, there was an hour of obituaries for two people I'd never heard of but who were quite big fish in the Basal Ganglia pond and this was immediately followed by "Mr. Steel and his Sunshine Band" without a pause. Seriously, it went like this,

".....and I will \*sob\* miss them \*floods of tears\* so so much. And now for some light hearted calipso music!!! Let's party!"

Bizarre, but highly amusing. Anyway, as soon as the music came on, they were all there dancing, sober as anything and only the English were left on the sidelines, unable to walk within 10 metres of the dance-floor without being tanked up. I bet they save a fortune.

To continue the drug abuse theme, on the last day, we went to Amsterdam:

I've been to Amsterdam before and done the stoner thing, so this time, I thought I might attempt to get some culture and check out a museum or two. All was going well until we popped into a coffee shop and asked for 2 teas and a coffee. The waitress told us politely, but in no uncertain terms that we had to buy some cannabis or get out. What a great country! Where else can you be thrown out of the establishment for NOT smoking weed?! You can't blame them though, I suppose it it kinda like going into a Thai massage parlor and just wanting a massage. Eventually I caved in and got stoned, Ric gave it a miss, while Jon stuck with the space cakes which I think they forgot to add the cannabis. I don't know if they were supposed to be left on the side and absorb any passing smoke, but weren't out long enough or what, but they were as weak as anything. Oh well, I had a good time inanely giggling at bus stops by myself.

\* - Yeah, that's the "International Basal Ganglia Society".

\** - And that would be Sheffield University's one and only "Adaptive Behaviour Reserch Group", of course.

\*** - I never worked out if this is meant to be arse-whole, as in the whole of you being an arse, or arse-hole, as in the bit you poo out of. I suspect it started as arse-whole and then it became an Americanism, thus turning into arse-hole because it's easier to spell and still makes sense...
