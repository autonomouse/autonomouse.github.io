I'm in a silly mood today. It's probably something to do with having to get up at 5.30am this morning.

To celebrate working out how to upload videos, I thought I'd upload an old clip Mitch took with his camera-phone aaaaages ago. I had to ask him where abouts on the server he'd put it though. In his reply, for reasons I won't go into, he'd mentioned that one of his ambitions was to "thwart an evildoer"

"Okay then." I sent him back, " I can hewp you. Weawange theth nemethetheth of everyoneth favourite thuper hewoes into  a thenthible order:

Lex Luther
Skelator
Joker, The

Then they'll be thwarted."

I don't think he got it.

Never mind - here's a much better/worse joke: IT'S THE TWO TURTLES JOKE!!!!!!!
