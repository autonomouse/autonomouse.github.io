I go through bouts of obsession........

Genius ideas that will never get anywhere if left up to me on my own - free broadband with distributred computing. The daftest idea I hadwas a grest ideas website where people could post their great ideas.

This stuff probably already exists, but just in case no-one's thought of it, I thought I should mention it so someone who IS capable of doing anything about it, but who hasn't thought about it, can. Even if I don't benefit, at least a) humanity as a whole (that includes me!) benefits, and b) I can say I thought of it first in the pub.

This is another reason why I like the philosophy behind open-source stuff like linux (I use Ubuntu). I see the potential.

HEre's a big question though - do they NEED microsoft - like a good-evil balance? :-)
