Before I begin today's rant, I have something to share with you. Wordpress (the blogging software used to make this site) comes with a handy stats page that tells you all sorts of wonderful stuff, including the search terms which were used to find this site via a search engine. It gives me great pleasure to report that somebody stumbled upon my site using the term "Gay Harrogate Wank":

<a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ghw.png" title="Oh dear"><img src="http://www.autonomouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/ghw.thumbnail.png" alt="Oh dear" /></a>

I wouldn't mind, but the bastard still didn't leave a comment. Even something along the lines of, "Nice site, but I think it needs more men masturbating in tea shops" would have sufficed. Meh.

Okay, so I spoke with Charles for the first time since my last posting and I've left the conversation not really knowing a) what exactly was said, or b) who won. I get the impression that I lost because he kept telling me so, but I have no idea why because I'm fairly certain that he didn't say anything relevant. He basically answered every question with a “Have you read <em>[place mysterious author name here]</em>? No? Well he says you're wrong” although at no point did he tell me what any of these people actually said. I've come to the conclusion that trying to have a debate with Charles is like trying to gift-wrap a fart – trying to pin him down to anything is pretty much impossible to do, people look at you funny as you attempt it and at the end of the day, no one's going to thank you.

One of the few things I did manage to ascertain was that he wanted me to go away and read some more, although I'm sure that reading more bit was optional. He did kindly offer to email me a reading list though. Seeing as though at present my own reading list has within it 'the children's colour illustrated guide to Socialism', maybe I need all the help I can get. Actually, its not that bad, but I have bought some "A Very Short Introduction To..." books on Socialism, Capitalism, Democracy, and Marx. I like this style of book - there's no point in reading some huge tome and still not understanding it. In that case, if you end up in a debate, you have to blag it and say stuff like: “Have you read <em>[place mysterious author name here]</em>? No? Well he says you're wrong” and then change the subject. I suppose I'd better check out this open-source gun dude's website afterwards as well. Can't do any harm to read what the other side's thinking. So I'll get back to this subject after I read more then.

Actually, this could well be part of a greater trend. As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/2007/10/09/rookie-mistake-17-total-failure-to-avoid-religion-and-politics-on-a-night-out">an earlier post</a>, I'm actually starting to get interested in all this politics stuff, but that's not all. Since beginning this blog, there's been a few people who have actually read it <em>[queue dramatic music and gasps of shock]</em> - Yes, I know, it came as much as a surprise to me as anyone, especially after the total failure of the last incarnation of this site. Still, I suppose even reading this could beat actually doing what you're supposed to be doing*. Anyway, so there've been a few other recommendations as well:

Jacqui keeps telling me about this college that she's involved with that does all this building a better society stuff tied in with it. I've been writing about this kind of thing (well, actually I haven't, but I keep meaning to finish <a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/save-the-world">it</a>). This place is called the <a href="http://www.schumachercollege.org.uk/index.html">Schumacher college</a> and it sounds promising. Well, actually, it sounds like a cult by the way she talks about it, but if its got her so worked up, it must be worth looking into. I promised her that I'd do just that, but that was ages ago now, so I guess I'd better get around to it. While I'm at it, I need to finish James Lovelock's The Revenge of Gaia that I borrowed from from her (IBAGS rudely interrupted it and I never got back into it again).

Next up is my brother's mate Dan, who found me on Facebook. He read my pro-liberalism post and sent me a message saying I should read The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins (way ahead of you, Dan) and also Essays of a Humanist by Julian Huxley. Once again, it's on the list, and will be read one of these days.

I was chatting with Tom the other day about direct democracy and the like. He'd somehow landed his book plug in New Scientist and I borrowed it off him (haven't finished it) and while I was there I took the opportunity to ask him about all this 'Wisdom of Crowds' stuff thats being thrown around in articles on the net a lot these days. It got me thinking, but I'll write separately about all that in another post.

This all draws me to several conclusions. Firstly, I need to read more; secondly, I need to finish books that I borrow from other people, 'cos it's rude otherwise, and thirdly that this whole university life is doing me good, but I never realised until I started keeping this blog. So, there'll be no complaining from me that I've got nothing to read for a while.

All in all, I think this blogging this is starting to broaden my mind. Yey! (or should I say "hurrah!"? Second thoughts, I think I'll stick to yey")
