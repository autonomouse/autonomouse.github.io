This site finds itself being called www.autonomouse.com and as I've described <a href="http://www.autonomouse.com/2007/07/01/autonomousecom-is-dead-long-live-autonomousecom/">in my firstest ever post</a> (in the site's current incarnation anyway), it wasn't always just a blog. I'd actually opted for the name prior to that when I was thinking of a username for this story website I'd joined.  It was called <a href="http://www.writewords.org.uk/members/show_profile.asp?member_id=3044">writewords</a> but I eventually decided to remove all my stuff from there in a fit of paranoia (one day I will be an author..... if I ever get around to it). But there was more than this, as a kid I'd played around with CB radios a bit and everyone on there had a 'handle'. It was basically what chat forums are now (there was probably a lot of wankers on there (literally) after midnight then I guess, but I never encountered them. That would have damaged my then fragile child mind). Finally, like all good geeks I watched the matrix far too many times and decided that I needed a web-based alterego. This is what led me to sit down with a thesaurus and look up a word to describe independent nature (whether or not I want to be!). I found autonomous. I banged an e on the end an lo and behold, instant name.

In uni I came up with the genius idea of starting up my own web design company. By this time, I'd already got the web address and so I thought I could be "Autonomouse: Independent mouse for hire!"

As it happens, I didn't even have the patience to build my own web site (let alone anyone else's*) without falling back on open-source content management systems, so I went to do a PhD instead (I know I'm a quitter).

So why am I wittering on about this? Well, Marj has just seen  an advert for an exhibition at the <a href="http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/">Whitworth art gallery</a> on her way to work and guess what it's called? Autonomouse. Snarf.  And here was me thinking I was being original. Potential spin off might be that I get increased numbers of people stumbling onto my web site, but I'm not sure if that matters - I'm writing this just for me really. Actually, seeing as though we're on the subject, whilst googling, I've come across other places where they've used autonomouse too and they all have a tenuous link to me, which is weird.

First of all, there's this ALECSYS project where they've designed a robotic gizmo that does something robotty based on a mouse (probably) and they've called it the autonomouse (Genius!), which is fair enough. Our group does a fair bit of animat type stuff and I currently share an office with a lass who's working on robotic rat whisking, but their name isn't as clever, so that's tenuous link #1.

Next up, there's <a href="http://www.openwebdesign.org/forum/showthread.php?p=2705#post2705">this</a> and <a href="http://autonomouse.wordpress.com/">this</a>, which I can only assume is the same person. The tenuous link here is that they've ended up using wordpress (although luckily, I got in there first with the dot com site) AND they've set up designing web pages. Looks like I've got me a nemesis! Thinking about it, I'd better be nice because once you link things to a wordpress site, it sometimes has a trackback thingmyjig that appears as a comment at the bottom of the page (Hello autonomouse2 you big imposter you**). Okay okay, I admit it, the name's good - even if I do say so myself - but its a big internet and it's somewhat unrealistic to expect nobody else to come up with putting an extra letter onto an existing word, but I was just getting used to having it as my pseudonym. Maybe I need to do something so big that the name is forever immortalised and no one will ever copy it. I'm not much of a hacker though and cyber crime just makes me laugh (heh, cyber, heh). Maybe I could be a superhero or something?

Finally, there is also a webpage showing some graffiti/street art... okay, <a href="http://www.osi.yaya23.net/gallery/1_us/11.html">graffiti</a>, saying "Autonomouses" and that was tenuous link #3, because...er... I've seen some graffiti before...

* - That's not entirely true - I did <a href="http://www.jellypot.com">this</a> for Steve at work, but it goes through occasional bouts of 'off-line due to lack of paying the bills-ness'

** - From the look of it, the site has long been abandonned. Shame, I could have had that one too and linked in the feed from this blog somehow. Ah well.

This mainly (its on the telly a lot at the minute for the new ipod commercials - it's called 1 2 3 4 by Feist and it's a bit good):
