As my good friend and threat to human decency, Matt Balderson would say, I'm a "tax-dodging, supernoodle-eating, fucking steeeeeeeeeeeeew-dent" and have been for some time. In fact, I'm 26 and haven't quite managed to leave school yet, which is quite an achievement. Actually, I had a couple of years working for a faceless pharmaceutical company  as a pharmacologist and corporate whore, but I still lived the student lifestyle. Perhaps more so as I had some money and no work to do after the hour of 4pm back then.

In these 8 or so years of doing the student thang, I've lived in many houses, in various places throughout England with lots of different people. I like to think that I've lived with some of the best... and alas, with more of the worst. Being a veteran house-mate seeker, this time around, I reckon that I've perfected the technique. It goes something a little like this:

First you put up an ad on t'internet ([Gumtree](http://sheffield.gumtree.com/)'s rather good for this) stating your situation, possibly slagging off your current poo-eating, clepto, gothchav, dentist housemate in the process (that was actually her name) and asking for people to look around houses with. You use this as a subtle excuse for going out on the piss. This will give you something to talk about for the rest of the year and, quite frankly, if you can't get on without the aid of your own bodyweight in alcopiss, then it's unlikely that you'll want to move in with that person. If by the end of the night, you are still talking, it's a good sign and you both arrange to find a third person to move in with and repeat the process. At some point, it might be wise to begin looking for a house as well. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER MOVE IN WITH MORE THAN TWO GIRLS. Girls are genetically programmed to bitch about each other behind each other's backs. If you have three or more, all hell will break loose by week 4. By week 12 the two that had fallen out will be best friends at the expense of the other one who will then be the bitchee. After that, it gets complicated and requires the application of chaos theory to adequately predict the outcome. Once you have accumulated four housemates/drinking-buddies and a house...erm, well, that's it really.

This system is the best because if you already rent a house, you're desperate to fill the room and may have to settle for a weirdo, and if your on your own looking for a room, you'll be very lucky to get on with everyone and they'll give you the box room and only half a shelf in the kitchen to put your food on. This way you screen all of the weirdos out and you know everyone will get on with everyone. It does take a bit of time though.... oh and a lot of money. It is fun though :-)

I feel the need to share this beautiful system with the masses, as now I will no longer need it. I have now moved most of my stuff and all of myself over to Marj's pad. On reflection, I could have cut out the whole house-hunting bullshit and saved myself a good 3 months of evenings and weekends, but we didn't think it was possible.

In the first year, I'd asked her to move in with me and she said "yes". There were initial problems: I couldn't leave Sheffield, and I wanted Marj to move over there with me. This did mean her giving up her well-paid job and was probable not a very sensible thing to do, but it did mean we could live together.  A slightly bigger problem was that her "yes" was shortly followed by a, "You do realise that we'd have to get engaged for my parents to be okay with us living together". To which I replied, "Ughflgrr?" or something equally as eloquent.

The current situation has been made possible by  the fact that now I'm not in the lab and am doing computational stuff, I don't have to be based in Sheffield, so I can live elsewhere and just VPN in. Also, now Marj has been living here for a while, her parents don't visit... er... at all (she goes around to theirs all the time). I do feel a little guitly that we're lying through our teeth to the inlaws. At this point, people would be wise to say things like, "it'll all end in tears" or "oh what a tangled web we weave..." or even "You could poke someone's eye out with that", however, none of this is enough to outweigh my desire to live with the bestest girl in the whole world (Hoyland poll, 2007), so I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens then.

So when my house was falling through and I was pulling my hair out and asking "Where am I going to live if this all falls through", she simply replied, "Come live with me". I was initially shocked as I thought we couldn't but slowly I worked through all of the reasons why I couldn't to find that they were now obselete (Even the one about me *hating* Manchester, but she lives in a... hang on... I mean *WE* live in a nice town out in the sticks just north on Manchester). So here I am, living in the nicest house ever with my girlfriend. The only proiblems I face are commuting in the Sheffield thrice a week, resisting the urge to beat the little [chavs](http://www.chavscum.co.uk/) that hang around only on the corner every so often and forgetting that the flush causes a small earthquake to occur in the wall pipes when used at any time passed midnight. All in all, life is good.

But anyway, as I said, I've lived with some dicks over the years, but this time around, I was lucky (or the systems perfect, one or the other). This group were a good bunch and I shall miss living with them. It's a shame we didn't go out as a group more often, but I am doing a PhD here and everyone else was busy with thier work or skint (I'm thinking of you Vicky), etc etc. Ah well, in another life and all that.

And so, yet another group of friends are disbanded to go do their own thing. So here are a few pickies to relive the good times:

and the grand finalle, a youTube clip posted by Tim around xmas time when Dave Rae came to visit me:

Yes, I know it's cheesey. The night before I showed him how to use Window's movie maker and I think he got a bit carried away, especially when it came to the music. I still can't believe he added Credits!

And for the record, Tim has no way of knowing.

Oooh - new thing. I'm starting to put little snippets of information at the bottom of this poage for future reference:Album listening to whilst blogging: The Fray's "How To Save A Life" then Semisonic's "Feeling Strangely Fine".
